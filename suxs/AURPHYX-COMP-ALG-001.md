1. Purpose
This document provides the rigorous mathematical foundations underlying AuraFS's physics-informed distributed storage architecture. Each algorithm implemented in the AuraFS Rust codebase traces to a theorem or proposition stated here, which in turn derives from the FTQC Thesis (Sections II–IV). For all you misled, peer reviewers, skeptics, ego-driven control freaks, closed minded sheep, and mainstream assholes can all use this document to verify that the code implements validated physics rather than ad hoc heuristics.

2.1 Lattice Definition
AuraFS organizes data shards on a Sierpiński gasket topology. The lattice is defined recursively.

Physical Implication. Since

​
 <2, the exponent 
𝑑
𝑠

d 
s
​
 /2−1<0 is negative, producing a divergent density of states as 
𝐸
→
0
E→0. This accumulation of low-energy modes creates natural "trap states" for quantum information — the mechanism underlying AuraFS's Trap-State data persistence model.
AuraFS Implementation: The PassiveCoherence trait in core/src/integrity/monitor.rs uses 
𝑑
𝑠

d 
s
​
 =1.37 (implementation clamp of the theoretical 1.365) as the baseline. If measured variance exceeds 
±
0.05
±0.05, the system triggers decoherence_recovery rather than a generic error, reflecting the physics-specific nature of the failure mode.

AuraFS Implementation: The replica distribution formula is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.1 applied to the storage domain. For

Replicas

⌈

Replicas=⌈log

This is implemented in FractalScaling::compute_replicas() with the bias parameter loaded from aurafs.toml (hilbert_scaling_bias = 5.3).

3. Anderson Localization & Coherence Enhancement
3.1 Physical Mechanism
Anderson localization on fractal lattices arises because 
𝑑
𝑠
<
2
d 
s
​
 <2 guarantees that all eigenstates are localized in the thermodynamic limit, regardless of disorder strength. This is in contrast to Euclidean lattices in 
𝑑
>
2
d>2, where a mobility edge separates localized from extended states.

𝑑

localized eigenstates reduce the effective coupling to decoherence aXes

AuraFS Implementation: The PassiveCoherence trait uses the 1600 μs coherence window as its tick interval upper bound. The decoherence suppression ratio (≥16×) determines the ratio of passive monitoring overhead to active correction overhead, justifying Phase II's exclusive reliance on passive coherence rather than active braiding.

3.3 Decoherence Recovery Algorithm
When the spectral dimension monitor detects 
∣
𝑑
𝑠
−
1.37
∣
>
0.05
∣d 
s
​
 −1.37∣>0.05, the following recovery procedure executes:

Freeze incoming writes. All Void-Shards in transit are held in a staging buffer.
Measure local IPR. Each node computes the participation ratio of its local shard distribution.
Identify delocalization sites. Nodes with PR > 2× median are flagged.
Re-shard affected data. Flagged shards are redistributed to restore the fractal partition structure (Definition 2.4 from Theorem 2.1 proof).
Verify recovery. Recompute 
𝑑
𝑠
d 
s
​
  from the updated lattice Laplacian. If 
∣
𝑑
𝑠
−
1.37
∣
≤
0.05
∣d 
s
​
 −1.37∣≤0.05, resume normal operation; otherwise, escalate to governance (Sages quorum, minimum 13 nodes). This procedure produces a PhysicsViolationError if recovery fails, not a generic error. The error type encodes the measured 
𝑑
𝑠
d 
s
​
 , the deviation magnitude, and the number of affected shards, enabling precise forensic analysis.

This represents a 16.4× reduction in physical-to-logical overhead (

1458/89≈16.4).
AuraFS Implication: The 16× overhead reduction directly translates to a 16× reduction in storage replication required for equivalent data integrity. This is the mathematical basis for the hilbert_scaling_bias = 5.3 producing logarithmic rather than linear replica counts: the fractal topology provides intrinsic redundancy that a flat DHT topology lacks.

4.3 Void-Shard Fidelity Composition
The total fidelity improvement factor of 16× decomposes into three independent contributions:

Contribution	Factor	Mechanism	Thesis Section
Passive Coherence	16×	Anderson localization (

 : 1600 μs vs. 100 μs)	Sec. II.8
Topological Protection	~3×	Non-Abelian braiding (neglecton phase)	Sec. III
Fractal Overhead Reduction	~2.7×	Physical-to-logical ratio (89 vs. 1458)	Sec. II.8
Phase II of AuraFS implements only the passive coherence contribution. Active braiding (topological protection) is deferred to Phase III, and fractal overhead reduction is realized through the replica distribution formula.

5.2 AuraFS Routing Application
The photonic band gap maps to a network routing overhead budget. The Meshwerk routing engine reserves 21% of total link capacity as a "guard band" to ensure zero-crosstalk between adjacent routing paths. Any packet routing that would exceed the 79% usable capacity triggers a reroute through the topology engine rather than accepting potential interference. The routing overhead formula is:

  This is enforced in network/src/meshwerk.rs with the photonic_band_gap = 0.21 constant loaded from aurafs.toml.
6. Cryptographic Integrity (Summary)
The mathematical integrity of AuraFS data is protected by Dilithium-5 digital signatures over the Merkle tree of Aura-Shards. The signature scheme's security rests on the Module-LWE problem, which is conjectured to be hard for both classical and quantum adversaries. Full details are in compliance/SECURITY_AUDIT.md. The hash function for the Merkle tree uses SHA-3-256, with collision resistance
